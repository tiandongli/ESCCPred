### ESCCPred: A machine learning model for diagnostic prediction of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using autoantibody profiles
ESCCPred is a prediction tool designed for early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). It utilizes machine learning algorithms to construct a diagnostic model based on serum autoantibodies. 
The model has been validated and shows promising performance with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The web-based interface of ESCCPred allows easy access to the diagnostic tool, providing a novel and serological method for early detection of ESCC.
